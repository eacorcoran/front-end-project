# NHL Team Info

A web application for NHL fans who want to easily see information about their favorite team(s).

## Why I Built This

For the final project of the first half of the LearningFuze coding boot camp, I wanted to build a front-end web application that would be useful to a wide variety of people. This web application will allow NHL fans to see the current, and historical, roster, schedule and related statistics for all active NHL teams.
